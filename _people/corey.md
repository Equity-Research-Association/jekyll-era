Corey currently is studying Bachelor of Commerce and majoring in Economics and Finance. He is extremely passionate about value investing, equity research and has invested in numerous companies across the world since 2018. 

Corey has gained further insights about equity research and fundamental analysis through his internships in investment management firms. He cofounded ERA with the intention to spread the essence of investment, that is, buying a company at price below its intrinsic value, being a part-owner of it and developing an in-depth understanding of its business.
