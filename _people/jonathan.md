I co-founded Equity Research Association (ERA) with the aim of providing students a hands-on experience on analysing equities as well as developing and honing the skillsets required in a supportive environment.

Previously, I held an Investment Analyst position in ZeroCap, a digital asset firm for private clients. I performed analysis on investing opportunities in the tech and media industry for private clients, high net worth individuals and institutions globally. I also sourced, researched and valued new start-ups for investment opportunities.

Seeking opportunities in investments and fintech. If you have a project I can help me, please get in touch.
