I am an equity researcher with over 2 years of experience. Passionate about financial markets and stock-picking strategies. I do my due diligence and market research, convert processable data into models to value firms' growth potential.

Love entrepreneurship and building sustainable startups. I am researching on the technology-cum-renewable energy sector.

Participant of international student exchange program (AFS), member of the World Scout Organisation and an avid King Scout. Constantly pushing boundaries, stepping out of my comfort zone into the real world and embrace changes.

Seeking opportunities to gain new knowledge regarding investment, finance and entrepreneurship. If you have a project I can help with, please get in touch.
