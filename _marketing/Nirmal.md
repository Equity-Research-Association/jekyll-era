Driven by an entrepreneurial spirit and inspired by Carl Sagan, I am up for sale to design software systems that can create new business opportunities and solve challenges in an enterprise. I enjoy exploring opportunities within the organization for the consumption of technologies from startups & open source stacks.  
  
I empathize with the experience of the end-user on utilizing a system and prioritize their ease of use and delight. I am super keen on nurturing the culture of innovation within an organization through the various schools of thought.  
  
My primary skillset is to architect technical solutions for business opportunities and challenges the enterprise. My skill is to solve, independent of the technology. Over the years I have built myself to be immune to the change in technology and have focused my energy on learning, applying & evolving new concepts and also enabling fellow colleagues.
